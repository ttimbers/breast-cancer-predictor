# Breast Cancer Predictor

Demo of a data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science workflows); a
course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of
British Columbia.

## About

Here we attempt to build a classification model using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm which can use breast cancer tumour image measurements to predict whether a newly discovered breast cancer tumour is benign (i.e., is not harmful and does not require treatment) or malignant (i.e., is harmful and requires treatment intervention). Our final classifier performed well on an unseen test data set, with the F2 score, where beta = 2, of 0.97 and an overall accuracy calculated to be 0.87. On the 171 test data cases, it correctly predicted 157. Nine mistakes were predicting a benign tumour as malignant, while 4 mistakes where predicting a malignant tumour as benign. This is somewhat promising for implementing this in the clinic as false positives are less harmful than false negatives. Although they could theoretically cause the patient to undergo unnecessary treatment if the model is used as a decision tool, it is likely that the model is used for initial screening and that there will be a follow up appointment and further testing until treatment commences. However, the observation of even 4 mistakes predicting a malignant tumour as benign is concerning. As such, we believe further development of this model is needed for it to have clinical utility. Research to improve the model performance and understand the characteristics of incorrectly predicted patients is recommended.

The data set that was used in this project is of digitized breast cancer
image features created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, W. Nick Street, and
Olvi L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (Street,
Wolberg, and Mangasarian 1993). It was sourced from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository (Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+\(Diagnostic\)),
specifically [this
file](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data).
Each row in the data set represents summary statistics from measurements
of an image of a tumour sample, including the diagnosis (benign or
malignant) and several other measurements (e.g., nucleus texture,
perimeter, area, etc.). Diagnosis for each image was conducted by
physicians.

## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

## Usage

### Setup

> If you are using Windows or Mac, make sure Docker Desktop is running.

1. Clone this GitHub repository.

### Running the analysis

1. Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the
   command line and enter the following command:

``` 
docker compose up
```

2. In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with 
`http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=` 
(for an example, see the highlighted text in the terminal below). 
Copy and paste that URL into your browser.

3. Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the command line 
and enter the following command to reset the project to a clean state 
(i.e., remove all files generated by previous runs of the analysis):

```
make clean
```

4. To run the analysis in its entirety, 
enter the following command in the terminal in the project root:

```
make all
```

### Clean up

1. To shut down the container and clean up the resources, 
type `Cntrl` + `C` in the terminal
where you launched the container, and then type `docker compose rm`

## Developer notes

### Developer dependencies
- `conda` (version 23.9.0 or higher)
- `conda-lock` (version 2.5.7 or higher)

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add the dependency to the `environment.yml` file on a new branch.

2. Run `conda-lock -k explicit --file environment.yml -p linux-64` to update the `conda-linux-64.lock` file.

2. Re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.

3. Push the changes to GitHub. A new Docker
   image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically.
   It will be tagged with the SHA for the commit that changed the file.

4. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file on your branch to use the new
   container image (make sure to update the tag specifically).

5. Send a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch. 

### Running the test suite

Use the same `docker compose up` command as described in the [Running the analysis](#running-the-analysis) section above
to launch Jupyter lab.
Tests are run using the `pytest` command in the root of the project.
More details about the test suite can be found in the 
[`tests`](tests) directory.
